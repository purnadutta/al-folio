<p>Hi, I am a first year PhD student at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> with the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">theoretical computer science group</a>. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://hunglvosu.github.io/">Prof. Hung Le</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/">Prof. Andrew McGregor</a>.</p>
        
<p>I finished BS and MS in Mathematics and Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iiserbpr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhampur</a>. I pursued my MS thesis project in theoretical computer science under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sakethome">Prof. Saket Saurabh</a> at <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/">The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a>.</p>
